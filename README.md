# Heart--Disease Prediction 

### Problem Definition in a statement: 
*Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?*

### Information about the Project : 

* Data : The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease
* There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset 

* Evaluation If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

* Features This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. You can do this via doing your own research (such as looking at the links above) or by talking to a subject matter expert (someone who knows about the dataset).
